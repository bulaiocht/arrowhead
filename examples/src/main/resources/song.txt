Hello darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely
As you used to be
How's your new love
Are you happy?
Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know means so much to me
What's that darlin'
How am I doin'?
I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep
I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm tryin' to say is
I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry
That I did you wrong
Look up darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time's sake
Let me hold you in my arms
One more time
Thank you darlin'
May God bless you
And each step you take brings you closer
To the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin'
I got to go now
I got to try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever
Find it in your heart
To forgive me
Comeback darlin'

I'll be waiting for you
