Two Roads Diverged In A Yellow Wood,
And Sorry I Could Not Travel Both
And Be One Traveler, Long I Stood
And Looked Down One As Far As I Could

To Where It Bent In The Undergrowth.
Then Took The Other, As Just As Fair,
And Having Perhaps The Better Claim,
Because It Was Grassy And Wanted Wear;

Though As For That The Passing There
Had Worn Them Really About The Same.
And Both That Morning Equally Lay
In Leaves No Step Had Trodden Black.

Oh, I Kept The First For Another Day!
Yet Knowing How Way Leads On To Way,
I Doubted If I Should Ever Come Back.
I Shall Be Telling This With A Sigh

Somewhere Ages And Ages Hence:
Two Roads Diverged In A Wood, And I
I Took The One Less Traveled By,
And That Has Made All The Difference.
