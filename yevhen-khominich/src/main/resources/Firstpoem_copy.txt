Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in  undergrowth.
Then took  or, as just as fair,
And having perhaps  better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that  passing re
Had worn m really about  same.
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept  first for anor day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took  one less traveled by,
And that has made all  difference.
